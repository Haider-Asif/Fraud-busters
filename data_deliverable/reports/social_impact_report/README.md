This is where you can type out your socio-historical context and impact Report.

### Socio-historical Context ###



#### Research the socio-historical context of your project to identify a few societal factors that could affect your data, prediction goal, and/or hypothesis. These factors might include current or historical policies, events, social conditions, larger societal systems, and more. Describe a few of the broader societal issues and their relationship to your data, prediction goal, and/or hypothesis. #### 
Broad societal issues and their relationship to the data:
The Pandemic: A current societal context that is affecting the rate of credit card fraud is COVID-19 pandemic. Fidelity National Information Services Inc. (FIS), which assists over 3000 banks with fraud monitoring, reported that attempted fraudulent transactions rose 35% in April 2020 from a year earlier (Wallstreet Journal). This spike is not captured in our dataset. This is because our dataset is collected in the year of 2013. This can present challenges in the utilization of our model when used on transactions post the pandemic, as the pandemic has caused an economic crisis which triggered the rapid spike in the number of fraudulent transactions.
The Entity in Question: The National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions delineate three different policy regulations that are put forth to protect consumers from card fraud (NAFCU). What is worth-noting is that these acts are protecting individuals and not affecting big business which are able to stand big financial losses, however, the entities that are the most impacted are: small businesses. CNBS warn that “there aren’t enough regulations protecting small businesses from chargebacks caused by fraudulent transactions.” (CNBS). Another article from Eater confirms that when speaking about the suffering of small restaurant business: “Credit card companies typically favor cardholders in these incidents and will issue refunds that the restaurants then must pay for” (Eater). Thinking about who is absolved by financial situations and banks and who is blamed shows bias against small business as banks tend to protect their customers. This challenges our data further in case there are false positives existing in the data that correspond to small businesses because of the biases in the relationship between financial institutions and entities.

#### Who are the major stakeholders in this project? What is your relationship to these stakeholders? Stakeholders are those who may be affected by or have an effect on your project topic. Some examples of stakeholders are a particular demographic group, residents of a particular geographic area, and people experiencing or at risk for a particular problem. ####
Fraudulent transactions pose a concern to almost every individual owning a debit/credit card, as well as businesses and financial institutions. The major stakeholders in this project are credit and debit card consumers, including individuals, small businesses, and big companies. Another group of major stakeholders is credit and debit card companies and financial institutions. CNBS reports that “companies such as Visa are looking to technological solutions including artificial intelligence to solve credit card fraud.”, and that “[Visa] “stopped $25 billion in fraud last year using Visa’s A.I. technology,”. Our project, a machine learning model would be parallel to such technology used by Visa, and so it can greatly benefit credit/debit card companies and their consumers in preventing fraudulent transactions. However, protecting some individuals might mean that another entity is held accountable for (or sometimes blamed falsely for) a fraudulent transaction, so minimizing bias here becomes of pivotal importance to make sure valid transactions are not mistakenly being classified as fraudulent by our model, a relevant example here is small businesses, as many banks favor their consumers over small businesses, and small businesses have to deal with significant losses because of customers’ false claims of fraud, which have also been on the rise due to the pandemic (Eater).

#### Discuss the impact of your socio-historical research findings on your project.  ####
The socio-historical research we have conducted gave us insight into the advantages and limitations of our data used in detecting fraudulent transactions. An important context we are living in is COVID-19 pandemic. Many recent articles we surveyed reported that due to the economic crises caused by COVID-19, there has been a spike in the number of fraudulent transactions. However since our dataset was collected in 2013, that means our data is not going to reflect this recent trend in the current economic context we are living in. This presents a limitation in how representative our dataset is to the current population of transactions, and how the accuracy of our model when tested on real-time data. Another food for thought our research gave us is who our research is impacting, we found that there are many false fraudulent transactions being thrown at small businesses as there are not as many policies to protect these small businesses. If the dataset features were not anonymized, it would have been helpful to know whether or not the transactions in the dataset belong to individuals, small businesses or big businesses and see if there is an anomaly in the number of fraudulent transactions corresponding to small businesses. 


### Ethical Questions ###


#### What kind of underlying historical or societal biases might your data contain? How can this bias be mitigated? ####
The way the data was collected is not detailed in the context of the data. It was collected over two days, so it seems not to favor one group of another if it was collected from a bank for example. Even though the actual data collection process will provide us more clues to whether there are any biases in the data set, there might be some inherent bias across racial or socioeconomic groups for examples due to the discrepancy with which each group relies on using credit cards. For example, families that earn less than $50k a year may not use credit cards as frequently as other families in higher income brackets. Therefore, if we find that there is a 10 percent chance that any transaction is a fraud (that percentage may be conditional on the number of transactions the user makes), it would be inaccurate to generalize that over all different demographics of credit card holders who use the card at different rates. However, the data is very anonymized so there is hardly any assumptions that we can make about any biases that exist within the dataset. 

#### How could an individual or particular community’s privacy be affected by the aggregation or analysis of your data? ####
If the data collected didn’t obscure the data fields, then the user from whom the data was collected is at risk of being re-identified, even if there no personal information was collected in the dataset. Just as the Guardian article details how anonymous data collected from Netflix was deanonymized after that data was crossed with data collected from IMDB and the addresses of some Taxi drivers were retrieved from this hack. This would put the user data at risk, and for financial information, like our project the threats defeat the point of the project. Since if a hacker is able to retrieve the personal information of a  user through the data collected, a hacker would have a way to access the user’s financial information that could be used to launch credit card fraud attacks. Thus the data that we are using could be a liability if not treated carefully to eliminate any risks of identification of users’ private information. 

#### Is data being used in a manner agreed to by the individuals who provided the data? ####
The data connected is a list of all transactions that occurred over two days in September 2013 by European card holders. However, there is no information on how the data was collected, and since we don’t know what the fields are, we have no clues who or what provided the data. Nevertheless, the extent to which the data was obscured makes us believe in good faith that the data was collected legitimately through one or many banks. There is no information provided as to whether the users who data was collected were aware of the collection of their data. There could be many possible scenarios of how this data was collected. Whether it is the banks or financial services (like Mastercard and Visa) that provided the obscured data or the data scientists themselves convinced people to provide that information are just two possible scenarios where data was collected legitimately. However, in the former scenario users may have not been informed about the usage of their data, which is arguably an unfair use of private data. If that was true, then the scientists and/or the bank are liable for the risks that they have posed on the users whose data was collected. If the obscuring method used in the dataset were to be disclosed or if the dataset was hacked some way or another where the hacker was able to deduce some meaningful information from the data, then the privacy and anonymity of the users is at risk, provided to a hacker probably with some malicious intention. The scientists who collected and uploaded this data should have provided more context into how this dataset was collected to clear issues around privacy and user protection. 

#### What are possible misinterpretations or misuses of your project results and what can be done to prevent them? ####
Our data is collected from users in Europe, which means that whatever patterns that emerge in the data might not necessarily reflect on all regions in Europe let alone abstracting the data to determine a pattern globally. Since we are not given information about where the transaction was made (besides the fact that it is in Europe), we can not make any confident regional interpretations of the analysis of the dataset. Another variable that could be overlooked is which demographic is represented in this dataset. The same way the Harvard Business Review points out the discrepancy of the data collected from Twitter to represent the intended demographic, we must be very careful in our analysis of this data to not make similar implicit assumptions that the data faithfully represents all of European credit card fraud patterns. Firstly, the data is collected only over two days, which may happen to be days where fraud is more common or less, so no clear long-term patterns about credit card frauds could be extracted. Secondly, the data may not be uniformly distributed across different categorizations (social, racial,geographical...), and thus falsely assuming that the data is uniform would yield inaccurate conclusions. Moreover, people in Europe may depend on credit card transactions more substantially or less than other places in the world, so attempts for credit card frauds may not be as frequent somewhere else where credit card use is not as common. The number of transactions with credit cards that are made in a particular region can give us insight into the likelihood of a fraud, because numbers don't tell the whole story, the rate of fraud is also important to consider. We should be careful not to make any assumptions about who the data represents and not to universalize patterns that occur on the short term in a particular geographic location to every credit card transaction all over the world.
